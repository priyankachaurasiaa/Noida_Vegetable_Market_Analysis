## Challenges

During the course of this project, we faced several challenges:

1. **Data Collection**: Obtaining comprehensive and up-to-date data from the Noida Vegetable Market and nearby markets proved to be a significant challenge. We had to ensure that the data collected was accurate and representative of the market conditions.

2. **Data Cleaning**: The raw data required extensive cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. This was a time-consuming process that required careful attention to detail.

3. **Seasonal Variations**: Identifying seasonal vegetables and understanding their price patterns presented a challenge due to the diverse range of vegetables and their unique growth cycles.

4. **Inflation Calculation**: Calculating inflation rates for different income groups based on vegetable basket prices required specialized calculations and assumptions.


## Dashboard

We have created an interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize the key findings and insights from our analysis. You can access the dashboard by following this link: [Power BI Dashboard](https://github.com/priyankachaurasiaa/Noida_Vegetable_Market_Analysis/blob/main/Pandas_Dashboard.pbix).

The dashboard provides an easy-to-navigate interface for exploring the data, visualizing price trends, and understanding the impact on different income groups. We encourage you to explore the dashboard for a more interactive experience.

## Conclusion

- Examination of vegetable price data in Noida and neighboring markets revealed substantial price fluctuations for both seasonal and non-seasonal vegetables.

- These price fluctuations can be linked to factors including transportation expenses, supply and demand fluctuations, and government regulations.

- Notably, low-income households experienced a more pronounced impact, with an average inflation rate of 5% recorded during the study duration.

- Overall, this analysis highlights the complexity of vegetable pricing dynamics and underscores the need for targeted policies to mitigate the financial burden on vulnerable households.
